//! Dynamic rigid bodies for DMO prop instances (Phase 2a).
//!
//! Every spawned prop gets a box body built on the TU3 rigid-body integrator
//! (`integrate_body_rates`): gravity and cool-down/sleep come from the retail
//! simulation step; the mass properties are the retail rounded-box finalize
//! path (`primitive_mass_properties`) with the instance's scaled template AABB.
//! Density is the authored MOBJ per-object value (`ObjectPhysics`, schema 3+);
//! friction, restitution and linear / angular drag come from the prop type's
//! retail DMO data ([`PropDynamics::set_type_data`]), with the authored MOBJ
//! values (project defaults friction 0.55, restitution 0.05, damping
//! 0.05/0.15) only for props whose type data is missing.
//!
//! Narrowphase uses the recovered GP pair query (`primitive_pair_contacts`):
//! box vs static-world triangles, box vs box for other props, and box vs the
//! skater's board/skeleton volumes for pushes. Contact response is the retail
//! row solver the board uses (ContactBatchBuild 82AE10C8 rows, 25 iterations
//! of 82AE27D0, `PropSolverSettings`); the engine's older impulse pass stays
//! selectable as a mod option. Sleep is the retail counter (integrator
//! 82AE6590, sleep pass 82DC3130) with the DMO island values.
//!
//! Props start asleep and cost one AABB test per skater volume per tick. A
//! skater contact or a moving prop wakes them. Moved instances re-bake their
//! triangle range in the prop collision layer so skater queries stay exact.
//! The held (carried) prop is exempt from both skater pushes and the rebake:
//! while carried it is velocity-driven and its layer triangles are parked far
//! below the world so they cannot push the carrier.
