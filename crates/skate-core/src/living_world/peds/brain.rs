//! A pedestrian's behaviour brain: the host the stock ped AI graph (`Pedestrian.stategraph`) runs
//! on (doc 26 "Ped behaviour runtime"). Retail runs that graph on the same dynamic controller as
//! the skater's graphs (`82C12E88` via `82C12DD0`; `.local/research/peds/b2-ped-aigraph-interpreter.md`),
//! so the shared `graph::controller` drives it here too; this module owns what the graph's
//! operations read and write: wants, timers and flags (the retail brain, `brain+412` wants,
//! `82E40940` / `82E40A80` timers, `+3232` honker, `+3281` bit 0x80 scatter) and the outputs the
//! body follows (motion intent, speed suggestion, flee target).
//!
//! Operations are parsed once from the graph's attributes ([`PedOp::parse`]); their values stay
//! data. Operations not ported yet are [`PedOp::Pending`]: their conditions answer false and
//! their behaviours do nothing, and the game reports them once (no silent default).
//! Retail bodies (`.local/research/peds/b3-first-slice-operations.md`, main checked Wander and
//! the warn timer): see each variant.
//!
//! Multiplayer: the brain is plain data owned by the host; wants carry stable target ids.
