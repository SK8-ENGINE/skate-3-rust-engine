//! Living world population core (doc `docs/hails-additions/26b-living-world-population.md`, milestone 2).
//!
//! One census engine for every ambient kind: NPC skaters, pedestrians and vehicles (props and
//! dynamic objects later). Pure and engine-independent: no ECS, no I/O, no rendering. The game
//! feeds observer positions, the census map and the session state once per console tick and gets
//! spawn / despawn decisions back.
//!
//! Retail reference (TU3, addresses are evidence only; values are re-implemented, not copied):
//! - census tick `sub_826B71F0`: one living-world type per tick in rotation (peds, vehicles, DMOs,
//!   props), each a cull pass then a spawn pass (`sub_826B7530` peds, `sub_826B7760` vehicles);
//! - ambient skater manager `sub_8245BA28`: a 60-tick phase cycle (cull, pool, spawn, checks).
//!
//! Multiplayer seams (no networking here): a decision is a pure function of
//! (config, seed, tick, observers, slot budget). It runs in one place (standalone or a future
//! host); everything downstream consumes [`Decision`] records, never the RNG, so a client can
//! replay the host's records. Every entity has a stable [`LivingWorldId`]; records carry what is
//! needed to recreate the entity on another machine, including the seed of its own sub-RNG.
//! Decisions never depend on hash-map iteration order or frame time.
