//! NPC skaters, replay tier: the line cursor (doc 26, milestone 3).
//!
//! Retail runs every NPC skater as a full skater steered along a recorded human line
//! (`AIController` + `PathController`, ctor `sub_824685F0`, vtable `0x822FBA1C`). The replay tier
//! is the engine's cheap stand-in until the simulated tier exists: the NPC follows its line
//! kinematically, node by node, at the recording rate (60 Hz, [data]: node distance / frames =
//! per-tick displacement over 389k nodes). What is ported 1:1 from the code is the **branch
//! choice** at a node that carries a branch group ([code] `sub_8246BEE0`, chooser `sub_8246C1C8`,
//! candidate score `sub_8246C230`):
//!
//! - candidates: index 0 = stay on the current line at the current node, then every branch target
//!   line that exists, is not in use by another skater (`sub_82458860`) and is valid
//!   (`sub_82456970`);
//! - each candidate is rejected (score -1, never chosen) when the line has no node after the
//!   candidate node (`sub_8246C3C0`), when the direction from the skater to that next node is 50 deg
//!   or more off the skater's forward (0.872665 rad, `0x822F91B0`), or when a node within one of
//!   the candidate node is airborne (flag 0x04) or carries an event (`sub_8246C4F8`; skipped at
//!   node 0); otherwise
//! - score = |angle| x 572.958 (`0x822F9354`, tenths of a degree) + 400 x speed (`0x822F95F0` =
//!   -400, the same for every candidate) + offline: 1024 x the other AI skaters on the same line
//!   within 5 nodes (`sub_82456A38`) + min(30 x the nearest distance from the player to every
//!   second node from the candidate node on, 1500) (`sub_8246C5D8`, `0x820D4924` = 30) + 1000 when
//!   the line's flags have bits 0, 1 and 2 all set + the skill term (|path skill - preferred| x 250 +
//!   100 when both are set and differ);
//! - the lowest score wins, the first on ties; when every candidate is rejected or the stay wins,
//!   nothing changes. No random draw is involved. The branch record's f32 is not read there.
//! - a taken branch starts at the target node nearest to the skater among `target - 3 ..= target`
//!   (`sub_82455BB0`).
//!
//! Replay-tier simplifications (documented in doc 26; the simulated tier replaces them):
//! positions, orientation and timing come straight from the recording instead of the steering
//! (`AIPhysicsInput`); the branch is evaluated once when the cursor reaches the group's node
//! (retail evaluates while the controller sits on it); the obstacle-list rejection of
//! `sub_8246C4F8` is not modelled (no obstacles yet).
//!
//! **Line end** ([code] `sub_8246D3C0` -> `sub_8246C7F8` -> `sub_82458968`, fix 9): no line on the
//! disc has a branch group on its last node; instead, when the controller reaches the last node,
//! retail looks for unused lines whose start node is within 4 m of the end ([data] `ai_skater`
//! tunable) and picks one with the branch chooser ([`choose_next_line`]), so an ambient skater
//! keeps riding from line to line until the population's distance cull (120 m from the player,
//! `sub_8245D520`) removes it. [data] 742 of the 760 DownTown lines have another line's start
//! within 4 m of their end. Only when none is near (retail would steer the full skater to the
//! nearest start at any distance) does the replay tier report [`CursorEvent::Finished`].
//!
//! **Presentation** (fix 14): a branch or chain moves the line under the skater (a chain up to the
//! 4 m radius). Retail's full skater steers onto the new line and never jumps; the replay tier keeps
//! where the skater was drawn at the switch ([`LineSwitch`]) and decays that offset (position and
//! orientation) with the graph transition curve over [`ChainConfig::blend_seconds`]. Samples carry
//! the render sub-frame ([`ReplaySample::sub_frame`]) so clip and blend times move between ticks,
//! and [`LineCursor::render_sample`] interpolates from the cursor one tick back with the recorded
//! branch decisions (the player's previous-to-current scheme), never guessing a branch.
//!
//! **Facing** (fix 23 corrected, 2026-10-08): retail's AI target frame is the recorded skater
//! frame slerped between nodes, turned 180 deg while the latched flip ([`LineCursor::flip`],
//! controller `+927`) is set; the flip is latched only on entering riding and held across
//! switches ([`FacingRule::RidingEntry`]). Retail's full skater steers its body toward that
//! target ([`steer_input`], 2 / 10 deg) and shows fakie / switch with its own clips and stance
//! mirror. The cursor always latches the flip; the puppet draws the retail target only under the
//! default `riding_entry` rule; the cursor runs retail's riding-fakie rule on the drawn body
//! ([`LineCursor::fakie`]) and the puppet overlays the stock fakie channel like retail, so a body
//! against its travel is drawn riding fakie. The fix 23 per-node fold ([`FacingRule::PerNode`],
//! not retail) stays a mod option.
//!
//! Multiplayer: between branches the cursor is a pure function of (line, start node, frames);
//! a branch decision is a record ([`BranchRecord`]) a client mirrors ([`LineCursor::step`] with a
//! mirroring decider), so a client reproduces the host's NPC from its spawn record, the frame
//! count and the branch records alone.
