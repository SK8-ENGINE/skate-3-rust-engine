//! Endless Tricks rungs: the flip ladder past retail's quad.
//!
//! **Not retail.** Skate 3's scorable table is 332 entries and tops out at `kickflip4` (135),
//! `heelflip4` (134), `n_kickflip4` (137) and `n_heelflip4` (136). Nothing here is added to that
//! table: `catalog::IDENTIFIERS`, `conversions::LINKS` and `SCORABLE_COUNT` are recovered data
//! and stay exactly as they are.
//!
//! Instead each extra rung **borrows the retail quad's ledger identity** and overrides only what
//! has to differ -- the published name, the displayed label and the points. That works because
//! the flip ladder *converts* rather than accumulates (`Carrier::convert_to`): the only things
//! that ever reach `ScoreHolder` are the surviving carrier's `Scorable` and its reward, and the
//! quad's `Scorable` is already the right ledger identity for a fifth flip. Same class 3, same
//! score type 2, same repetition bucket, same conversion source. So `Scorable::valid()` passes,
//! `LINKS[135]` is in range and `by_id(135)` resolves -- none of the out-of-range hazards that
//! minting a 333rd id would create.
