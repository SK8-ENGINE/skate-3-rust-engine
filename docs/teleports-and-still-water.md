# Travel menu and still-water follow-up

## Travel

Esc → Teleport lists the original English frontend location names for usable
destinations on the currently loaded map. A continuous list supports mouse-wheel
scrolling, a draggable scrollbar and keyboard selection that scrolls into view.
There are no pages or cross-map destinations in this menu. The installer
now extracts `private/teleports.json` by joining `fe_locations`, the shipped label
and English language tables, and global RX2 locator records. Names are joined by
their label hashes, not string-table order. The special skate wordmark byte is
represented as `skate.` in plain text.

The current owned installation yields 42 frontend destinations, 41 with unique
authored transforms. `Stadium - Monster Park` remains in the catalog but is hidden
from the menu because it is unavailable:
its reference `vert_skp5_01_challengelocator_01` was not found in the global
locators or the inspected mission payload. No substitute position is invented.
Frontend templates and unnamed park-layout aliases are excluded.

Same-map travel queues the existing player-input teleport/reset service and
updates the checkpoint. The `--teleport ID` startup adapter also checks that the
destination belongs to the loaded map; menu travel does not restart the session.
Authored height and orientation are preserved. Runtime arrivals and menu layout
have not been checked in a running game.

Evidence: TU3 `cGlobalFileLocationManager::LoadGlobalLocations` at `0x828A3D50`
loads `data/content/global_locators/*.rx2`. The RX2 `0xEB0009` section contains
128-byte records with the transform at +0, name pointer at +104, tag pointer at
+108 and identifier at +112. The parser validates record and string boundaries.
All 41 resolved positions have collision surfaces beneath their authored X/Z in
the exported maps; vertical offsets range from approximately -0.008 to 4.536 m.
This is an offline placement check, not a gameplay arrival test.

## Rendering

Still-water materials (`water.default`, `water.alpha`, `water.skatepark`) now
have a dedicated family. Retained shader names upgrade older map packages at
load time. The shader implements the decoded two-layer PCA normal reconstruction,
UV scrolling, refraction, four-tap lightmap sampling and literal shadow floor.
Flowing-water materials keep their existing family. Still water requires the
private ocean PCA sidecar; automatic extraction of that sidecar from a fresh
installation remains outstanding, and missing data uses the existing fallback.

The default and alpha pixel shaders have 128 bytes of literal constants before
their instructions. SHA-256 of their instruction streams:

- Default: `B5F39F3080C89A220250E87643C5AD15F4A94B42B2C3DCB6BAF090E036FE3B5A`
- Alpha: `81D9905165B28B03C3623D18887E7E9D9303D3FFDA072993B8C183D24BD3A547`

An offline register evaluator compared 600 normal/refraction cases across all 30
owned PCA frames with the implemented algebra (maximum error 2.22e-16). This
does not establish full pixel-shader or GPU visual parity. Private disassembly
and validation output are under `logs/renderer-work/shader-inspect`.

Exposure extraction now follows each map's render-location reference and its
inherited exposure settings into `private/exposure-profiles.json`. Runtime
selects the active map's profile, with the existing global fallback. The ten
current profiles resolve to the same values, so selection alone need not produce
a visible change.

## Remaining parity work

- Spatial lighting/colour transition volumes and their native controller.
- Exact colour grading: profiles reference `cc_financial.rgb`, which was not
  found in the inspected content. The available `cc_petes.rgb` is not evidence
  that this different lookup table should be applied.
- Native bloom composition, console shadow-atlas filtering and the per-frame
  shadow-colour controller.
- Fresh-install ocean PCA extraction and in-game water/teleport validation.

Movable-object work is deferred at the user's request. Hair is unchanged.

## Checks

Release build, four filtered Rust menu tests, eight Python extraction/environment
tests, and composed world/depth shader validation passed. All ten map packages
passed the offline reader; their geometry/collision tails remain byte-identical
to the installed inputs. No game or recomp was launched. Owned assets and private
inspection artifacts are not committed.
